# Stack3D Keybindings
# ========================================

# Cycle through different layout types (grid → circular → spiral → fibonacci)

# Alternative keybindings (uncomment if preferred)

# Stack3D Tips
# ========================================

# Tips for best Stack3D experience:
# 1. Use 3-6 windows per workspace for optimal visual effect
# 2. Adjust transition_duration to your preference (0.5-1.2s recommended)
# 3. Try different layout types with the cycle keybinding
# 4. Enable motion blur for smoother visual feedback
# 5. Experiment with perspective settings for different 3D depths
